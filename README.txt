Python Video Player

This is the project that was given by my employer during my intership at Techcliks. The objectives were to be able to download a list of videos with given URLs in a text file, and then us a python video player
to auto play  3 seconds then pause for 3 seconds.The idea was that the users can repeat what the video say during the first 3 seconds to practice speaking.
